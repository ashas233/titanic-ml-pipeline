# Titanic ML Pipeline â€” Foundations & Data Proficiency

## Overview
This project implements a complete beginner-friendly ML pipeline using the Titanic dataset. It covers:
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree modeling
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, wordcloud, joblib

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. The notebook will output analysis, plots, and trained model files.

## File Structure# titanic-ml-pipeline
## Next Steps
- Add hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy model as a web app with Flask or FastAPI
